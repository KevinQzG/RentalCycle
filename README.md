# RentalCycle

RentalCycle is a project that offers a bicycle rental management system. It provides a platform where users can register, rent bikes and keep track of their rentals.

The project is designed to help bike rental universities efficiently manage their inventory and allow users to rent bikes quickly and easily.

### Main Features

- Admin: There is an administrator section, which from there, you can add, edit or delete records from the database, which includes groups, users, rentals, bicycles, promotions, employees, students and maintenance.
- Others: Thanks to the triggers, functions, and procedures carried out in MySQL, when adding a user, he will automatically have pascal case in his first and last name, by default bicycle rentals will be for 7 days and if this period is exceeded, the admin will be notified.

### Main future features

- User registration: Users can register on the platform by providing basic information, such as name, email address and password.

- Bike Search: Users can search for available bikes to rent based on their location, date preferences, and other filters.

- Bicycle reservation: Users can reserve a specific bicycle for a certain period of time. This ensures that the bike is available when the user needs it.

- Rental Management: Users can keep track of their current and past rentals, view duration, cost, and other relevant information.

- Payment system: The project also provides a payment functionality to allow users to pay for bike rentals safely and conveniently.
